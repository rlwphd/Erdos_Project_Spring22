Erdos Institute hosts a data science boot camp each year and this repository contains the location for our code for the group project in Spring '22.

We have chosen to analyze financial consumer complaints for being able to rate different financial institutions.

--Currently a work in progress

To do: 
1) Calculate the naive classifier micro F1 baseline score. 
2) Plot PR and ROC-AUC curves for 10%-RoBERTa model.
3) Hyperparameter tune training epochs and learning rate for the final model with random search (each iteration takes ~30 min).
